/**
 * @brief ViewerDelegateComponent used to render USD locations.
 *
 * This class has a reference to the HydraComponent that holds an instance of
 * HydraKatana in order to populate its Render Index with Prims from usd stages.
 * This detects locations of the type "usd" and populate the Render Index with
 * the corresponding usd stage. The stages will be read from the UsdKatanaCache
 * singleton so that they can be reused by and from Katana's other plugins (the
 * PxrUsdIn node, for example). See the USDLocationData class (usdLocation.h),
 * which is the ViewerLocationData implementation for locations of the type usd.
 *
 * Usd prims that can be rendered, when added to a Render Index via a
 * UsdImagingDelegate become RPrims. All the usd related RPrims will be added to
 * the Render Index under a SdfPath root/namespace (SDF_PATH_ROOT) under which
 * all the USD stages loaded by this VDC place their RPrims.
 *
 * Katana USD locations will have a corresponding RPrim path that differs only
 * in the fact that the RPrimpath will be prefixed with SDF_PATH_ROOT. RPrims
 * loaded by an usd location will have a path of this form:
 *   /[SDF_PATH_ROOT]/[LOCATION_PATH]/[STAGE_PRIM_PATH]
 *
 * A stage will load only the prims under the ReferencePath (as defined by the
 * "referencePath" on the usd location), but their full path will be used to the
 * their corresponding RPrim path. For example, if a usd location "/my/location"
 * loads a stage that contains an prim called "/a/b/c/d" and the reference path
 * set to /a/b, then the resulting RPrim path will be:
 *   /[SDF_PATH_ROOT]/my/location/a/b/c/d
 * In this case any prim under /a that is not under /a/b will not be loaded,
 * since it is outside the scope of the reference path.
 *
 * This VDC and its companion USDLayer allow the selection of rendered RPrims.
 * They implement two selection modes, driven by the m_useRprimSelection flag: 
 *
 *  - RPrim Selection: in which RPrims of loaded stages can be highlighted, 
 *    framed by the F key and dragged out of the Viewer. In this mode the
 *    locations that correspond to the selected RPrims that are under a proxy
 *    will be selected in Katana (albeit not being expanded at that moment).
 *    This is called "Sub-Proxy Selection" in the UI. This happens when
 *    m_useRprimSelection == false.
 *
 *  - USD Location Selection: in which the location of the type "usd" (proxy or
 *    non-proxy) that loaded the picked RPrim will be selected. This is a more
 *    standard Katana behaviour. This happens when m_useRprimSelection == true.
 *
 * XXX: Since Foundry did not provide yet a way of framing the camera when the
 *      F key is pressed on an arbitrary bounding box (it only frames on
 *      existing locations that the Viewer can see that contain the "bound"
 *      attribute), we use a ficticious location created by a Viewer terminal op
 *      (RPRIM_BOUNDS_LOCATION_PATH) where the bounds of the selected RPrims
 *      are written in its "bound" attribute. This location is always selected
 *      when in RPrim Selection mode, so that the user can frame the camera on
 *      the selected RPrims, which do not correspond to locations that the
 *      Viewer is aware of.
