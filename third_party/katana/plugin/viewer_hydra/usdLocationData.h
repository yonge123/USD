/**
 * @brief USD location data to be held by usd ViewerLocations.
 *
 * These are instantiated by the USDComponent VDC and added to the location tree
 * managed by HydraComponent. The render index into which the Prims are loaded
 * are then rendered by HydraLayer ant once, together with other hydra rendered
 * location types.
 *
 * This contains the UsdImagingDelegate scene delegate responsible for
 * populating the HydraKatana's Render Index with the USD stage for the location
 * that holds this location data object. This also stores the USD stage, which
 * allows for accessing the Prims that correspond to an RPrim aded to the Render
 * Index. This also uses a UsdGeomBBoxCache to calculate/cache the bounds of
 * Rprims, used when framing the camera on selected RPrims, for example.
